Given a list of N students, every student is marked for M subjects.
Each student is denoted by an index value. Their teacher Ms.
Margaret must ignore the marks of any 1 subject for every student.
For this she decides to ignore the subject which has the lowest class average.
Your task is to help her find that subject, calculate the total marks
of each student in all the other subjects and then finally return the
array of the total marks scored by each student.
